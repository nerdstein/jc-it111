      <p>Welcome to IT 110 &#8211; Principles of Information Technology, a &quot;Hybrid&quot; 
        Online Course. This course is part of an exciting new time here at Juniata 
        College - a time when the traditional hands-on learning style that has 
        made Juniata College so successful melds together with the inevitable 
        growth of technology. IT110 is presented in a content rich, hands-on, 
        web-based manner. We call this a hybrid course because you will spend 
        considerable time &#8220;on-line&#8221;. NO &#8211; we are not becoming 
        an online institution! The fact of the matter is, however, that in your 
        lifetime, the use of the web for learning will increase dramatically (you 
        will discuss this later in the course). Most, if not all, of you already 
        are quite comfortable gathering information from the web or other &#8220;technological&#8221; 
        sources (email, AOL Instant Messaging, etc..). The use of technology in 
        your education will also continue to grow during your college education 
        and throughout your lifetime as you will come to recognize the need for 
        lifelong learning here at Juniata College. The course delivery will be 
        a mix of web-based and classroom activities - thus making it a &quot;hybrid&quot; 
        approach. This approach incorporates weekly meetings with the instructor 
        along with interaction through the WWW via such interactive elements as 
        &quot;threaded discussions&quot;. </p>
      <p>Here at Juniata College, the IT110 course is an exciting and different 
        type of course. At present, there are several main themes or tracks that 
        have been developed &#8211; Business, Bioinformatics, Environmental, Digital 
        Media, and Computer Science. In truth, these tracks will continue to develop 
        &#8211; as you are part of the development! The goal of the redevelopment 
        is NOT to develop many distinctly different courses, but rather to develop 
        variations of the course that may be intertwined.</p>
      <p><strong>What is Information Technology?</strong></p>
      <p>At Juniata College, IT means understanding the importance of communication 
        skills, having an appreciation for IT's role in providing competitive 
        advantage in today's world, and appreciating the wide-spread acceptance 
        of multi-platform, distributed computing environments. Specific technologies 
        will continue to come and go, but the ability to communicate effectively 
        and see the &quot;big picture&quot; will remain critically important for 
        IT professionals as they develop and deploy the latest technologies to 
        solve real-world problems. An interdisciplinary approach will prepare 
        you well.</p>
      <p><br>
        The overall goal of ALL tracks is to provide the student with a basic 
        introduction to technology. The goal of the individual tracks is to illustrate 
        the notion that technology has and will continue to permeate all aspects 
        of society. Given this, it is desirable to have the students from each 
        track develop a basic familiarity of the following technology concepts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Intoduction</li>
        <li>History of Technology/Computing</li>
        <li>Introduction to Computing</li>
        <li>Networks</li>
        <li>Web Development</li>
        <li>Databases</li>
        <li>Multimedia Applications</li>
        <li>Current &amp; Emerging Technologies and Issues</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The above concepts will be presented in module format to each section. 
        Variations based on the theme or track of each section will then exist 
        within each section.</p>
      <p><strong>Concept of Variations</strong></p>
      <p>While the above concepts will be common to all sections, there will be 
        variations within each section. Consider, for example, the Database subject. 
        This, in itself, is a very large topic and you will spend approximately 
        2-3 weeks discussing database concepts, design, development and implementation. 
        The variations between sections will occur once the basic concepts have 
        been covered. The environmental section (flavor) may then continue to 
        examine databases common in this field (e.g. toxic release sites), while 
        the business track examines or develops a database of potential clients 
        or customers.</p>
      <p><strong><em>EXAMPLE:</em></strong> In the Database Objective, the assignment 
        is to read the introduction to databases material and work through the 
        basic examples provided. Class time will then be spent reviewing the basic 
        concepts of a database and demonstrating additional database software 
        packages such as ACCESS, GIS, or ORACLE to name but a few. After these 
        introductions and demonstrations an additional assignment may be announced 
        that will have you apply these new tools. This is where the individual 
        sections or tracks will begin to differ the most. At this point, all students 
        will have been introduced to the database concepts, but individual sections 
        will then apply these concepts in a different manner. For example, the 
        &#8220;business&#8221; track may develop a database used for market analysis 
        of real estate costs, while the &#8220;environmental&#8221; section may 
        create a database of hazardous waste sites (which, by the way, could easily 
        be used in the real estate study). </p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FF0000">VERY IMPORTANT!</font></strong> &#8211; 
        You will see the variations at the end of the basic reading, at which 
        point you will be directed to readings and/or assignments specific to 
        your section.</p>
      <p><br>
        Other commonalities will exist as well. A common set of online quizzes 
        or exams will be given, as well as a common online final. A final project 
        will also be required for each section, although instructors may choose 
        to implement this in a variety of ways (i.e. team based vs. individual 
        or report vs. presentation, etc..) or any combination within.</p>
      <p>Following are brief summaries for the individual modules. Topics to be 
        covered and potential variations between sections are provided. Weeks 
        of the semester to be devoted to a particular module are estimated, as 
        is a running total. </p>
      <p><em><strong> Introduction</strong></em></p>
      <p>Topics - This will be a basic introduction to the course. The introduction 
        will discuss the various outcomes and objectives that will result from 
        the successful completion of any section of this course. The impact of 
        technology on nearly all sectors of society will be introduced and will 
        lay the groundwork for the various sections of IT110 at Juniata College. 
        Goals of the course and a rationale for having a hybrid online course 
        will be discussed. Expectations and responsibilities will also be covered. 
        The course management system (Moodle) will be introduced. 
        Other educational and collaborative software packages, such as enote, 
        may also be introduced.</p>
      <p>Variations &#8211; There will be little, if any, variations in between 
        the various sections in this module, though individual instructors will 
        provide a rationale as to why the application of technology in a particular 
        area is relevant to all participants in the course. </p>

        bioinformatics may look at the first genome sequencing or the first use 
        of computers to analyze and duplicate DNA. Students in the environmental 
        section could evaluate technologies for monitoring the environment or 
        the history of computing in the EPA.</p>

        Week 13 &#8211; Emerging Technologies<br>
        FLOATER WEEK - There is one floater week.</p>
      <p><strong><em>PLEASE NOTE &#8211; this is an anticipated schedule. There 
        may be slight variations.</em></strong></p>
      <p>Each week, you are to have completed the readings and worked through 
        the various assignments before coming to class that week. There are numerous 
        exercises and assignments throughout the readings. There may also be thought 
        or study questions about the readings (these will be in Moodle). You 
        are to complete these questions and then contribute additional thoughts/questions 
        about the readings.</p>
      <p><strong>Exercises vs. Assignments</strong></p>
      <p>There are both exercises and assignments. The basic difference is that 
        the exercises are not graded, while the assignments are graded. <font color="#FF0000"><strong>ALL 
        GRADED ASSIGNMENTS CAN BE FOUND IN THE COURSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM VIA MOODLE...</strong></font>. It is possible that you instructor may 
        also give additional information regarding an assignment; however, it 
        will be listed in the course management system.</p>
      <p><strong>So basically, your weekly checklist for this course is as follows:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete all readings</li>
        <li>Complete all exercises within the readings</li>
        <li>Complete all assignments 
          <ul>
            <li>Post Thought/Study questions in Bb (if they exist)</li>
            <li>Additional assignments (if they exist)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Come to class prepared to discuss the topic of the week.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Online Collaboration</strong></p>
      <p>As you will see throughout the course, the sharing of information is 
        critical to society. This includes online collaboration. Online collaboration 
        is part of IT110. Here at Juniata College, we use a course management 
        system (CMS) to &#8220;manage&#8221; a number of courses. You may ask: 
        &#8220;What is a course management system?&#8221; A CMS is a website (a 
        big one) that allows instructors and students to collaborate during a 
        course. Functions of a CMS include providing course content, testing, 
        threaded messages, email, and homework (assignment) repositories to name 
        but a few. Here at Juniata College, we use Moodle as our 
        course management systems.</p>

      <p><strong>The Technologies</strong></p>
      <p>You will using a variety of technologies in this course, however, the 
        majority of your time will be on the computer using a web browser. Sincre 
        you are reading this, you can see that the course content is all contained 
        in this website (http://projects.juniata.edu/it110). This site is divided 
        into several parts:</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../../images/main_image_interactive.gif" width="683" height="562"></p>
      <p>If you click on the &quot;Interactive Links&quot; portion, you will see 
        a number of links that will or may be used throughout the semester. There 
        a relinks to Moodle, faculty, a &quot;quick help&quot;, and links 
        to additional readings.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="../../images/interactive_out.gif" width="641" height="553"></p>
      <p>Your instructor will discuss the various features of this site with you 
        in class.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Let's try some of the features of the site and a few examples of your 
        typical activites:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>First let's make sure that you can find the INTERACTIVE LINKS. Simply 
        &quot;mouse over&quot; the IT110 Interactive menu. Do see all of the links? 
        Click on Moodle and make sure that a new browser window opens and 
        the main Moodle login screen will appear. Click on your particular 
        section (Environmental, Biology, or Business) and a new window should 
        appear with additional readings (there are none for this portion of the 
        class).</p>
      <p> Let's try a discussion activity. Recall that discussion acitivies will 
        appear throughout the course content (they may also appear in the additional 
        readings section. All discussion (also called threaded discussions) are 
        handled in Moodle. So when you see a discussion question, read the 
        question (it will also be in Moodle) and then use the IT110 Interactive 
        Menu to go to Moodle) and then navigate to <strong>Forums</strong> 
        and respond to the discussion question.</p>
      <p><strong>Discussion Activity #1</strong></p>
      <p>This is a very simple discussion activity - Please introduce yourselves 
        to the others in this class by responding to this discussion board. Please 
        provide information about your major and interest in taking this course. 
        Upload a picture of yourself, or if you are camera shy, a pet's picture 
        will do. For those of you who do not have a ready .jpeg of yourself, &quot;stalker&quot; 
        net will do!</p>
      <p>To compete this assignment simple go to Moodle and login (if you are not 
        already logged in). Next go to IT110 (your section) and navigate to Forums,

      <p><strong>Assignment #1</strong></p>
      <p>Assignment #1 is very simple. Go to the WWW (or other sources) and search 
        for references that define Information Technology. In other words, &quot;What 
        is IT?&quot; Put this in MS WORD. Also include your thoughts on this definition. 
        Do you agree? Disagree? Why. When you are finished - go to Moodle and navigate 
        to Assignments. Go to &quot;What is IT&quot; and upload your WORD 
        document.</p>
      <p>That's about it.....!</p>
