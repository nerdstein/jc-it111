          Technologies Analysis</span></h4>
        <p>Emerging technologies are innovations that beget new technologies, 
          in other words, technologies that are completely new and possess the 
          ability to transform our understanding of a particular field of study.  
          Examples abound in the field of medicine, computing, transportation, 
          manufacturing, and energy.  How do we encourage the development of these 
          innovations? And, what do we do to enhance their diffusion and market 
          their potential?  Answers to these questions can increase company profits 
          and even positively impact a nation’s GNP, not to mention cure diseases 
          and help end hunger.  While these promises may seem exaggerated, without 
          innovations, decline and disease will run rampant.  Examples of such 
          innovations from MIT’s Magazine of Innovation Technology Review (February, 
          2003) include injectable tissue engineering, nano solar cells, wireless 
          sensor networks, mechantronics, grid computing, molecular imaging, nanoimprint 
          lithography, software assurance, glycomics, and quantum cryptography.  
          A search on these terms will enable you to get a summary of each of 
          these technologies.  You can also check out MIT’s website on new technologies: 
        </p>
        <p>As a company, you would need to review the viability of an emerging 
          technology that might provide strategic advantage.  A simple way to 
          review such technologies would include a review of their intended use, 
          costs/drawbacks, practical applications, competing technologies, widespread 
          use (diffusion), and impact on the organization or, for this course, 
          impact on the web professional.  Sample reviews of some emerging technologies 
          follow: <a

        <p>Additional web sites that often report on new technologies include: 
          <a href="http://www.wired.com/">http://www.wired.com</a></p>
        <p><a href="http://www.cnet.com/">http://www.cnet.com</a></p>

        <h1>Enhanced Reality</h1>
        <p><u>Intended Use:</u></p>
        <p>Enhanced reality combines hardware and software to enable the user 
          to use technology to increase the accuracy, ease, and ability of executing 
          every day functions.  Examples range from holding one's daily schedule 
          in a user's watch or other personal trigger object that would remind 
          the user about meetings to assisting in an operation by projecting the 
          image of previously conducted surgery to act as a step by step procedural 
          guide.  </p>
        <p><u>Costs/Drawbacks:</u></p>
        <p>The costs associated with enhanced reality can be high.  Software and 
          hardware range from relatively inexpensive (such as using a PDA) to 
          high cost hardware and software development.  Therefore, one must decide 
          “at what cost” do we develop and use enhanced reality.  For example, 
          if enhanced reality in an operating room environment increases the survival 
          rate of the patient significantly over traditional operating room technology, 
          then one can argue that the cost is worth it.  However uncomfortable, 
          decisions will need to be made regarding heath care costs and insurance 
          reimbursement for enhanced reality.  It may come down to the “haves” 
          and “have nots” in terms of access to expensive health care which integrates 
          enhanced reality.  In fact, overall, the digital divide may be replaced 
          by the technology affordable divide.  You won’t need to understand how 
          to use the technology, but you may need to be able to pay for it.</p>
        <p>Regardless of costs issues, there are additional drawbacks associated 
          with enhanced reality.  For example, one may question whether enhanced 
          reality actually deepens our sensory contact with reality or in fact 
          reduces it.  Thus, we may end up questioning the actual definition of 
          reality.  Some may argue that enhanced technology actually warps one’s 
          perception of reality; however, I believe that enhanced reality will 
          allow us to understand and appreciate a deepened sensory and perceptual 
          experience that will be tantamount to a richer and more vivid understanding 
          of the “real” world.</p>
        <p>Finally, less philosophical, more practical drawbacks include the uncomfortable 
          addition of hardware and software in our daily lives.  So, it may mean 
          wearing a hard hat with audio and video equipment attached to engage 
          our enhanced reality.  It will also, I argue, mean that we have less 
          “down” time and more stress associated with an increased desire to achieve 
          the productivity enabled by enhanced reality.</p>
        <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
        <p>A typical user of enhanced reality would encounter uses like the following:</p>
        <p>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          </span>A teacher or storyteller could read a picture book and associate 
          each picture with the text that is triggered by audio clips assigned 
          to each page.  Then, a pre-reader can look at the picture and listen 
          to the audio clips.</p>
        <p>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          </span>A factory worker or ordinary consumer can view real time instructions 
          for assembly which are presented based upon completion of each step.</p>
        <p>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          </span>A visually challenged person could benefit by a verbal description 
          of objects in his/her field of view.</p>
        <p>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          </span>An important client conversation can be recorded and placed on 
          the person’s business card.</p>
        <p>-<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
          </span>The visual appearance of an object can be augmented by relevant 
          audio and video.  Examples of this are already in place in many museums. 
        </p>
        <p>Additional examples are endless…</p>
        <h2>Competing Technologies</h2>
        <p>Virtual reality can be perceived as competition to enhanced reality.  
          Many people may prefer to “doctor-up” the real world with fantasy.  
          In other words, they might prefer to spend time in a virtual world rather 
          than the “real world”.  In a virtual world one can integrate reality 
          with fantasy for the amusement of the user.  We have all experienced 
          this desire when we choose to go to the movies and view fiction over 
          a documentary.  Game playing also uses a lot of virtual reality.  These 
          are forms of entertainment.  However, where does one draw the line and 
          where are you willing to spend your discretionary income?  Personally, 
          while I often choose fiction over nonfiction, I prefer to purchase technology 
          that will enhance my everyday functioning rather than spend money to 
          enhance my ability to engage in “virtual reality”.  For example, one 
          of my recent purchases was a digital camera to improve my memory of 
          vacations, students, and special events.  Reality that is not enhanced 
          or “every-day” reality also competes with enhance reality. </p>
        <h2>Widespread Use of Technology</h2>
        <p>Whether or not one considers enhanced reality to be widespread depends 
          on how one defines enhanced reality.  For example, eye glasses can actually 
          be considered a form of enhanced reality.  If one narrows the definition 
          to include the use of technologically advanced hardware and software 
          to increase the accuracy, ease, and ability of executing every day functions, 
          then enhanced reality is not as widespread.  However, we still see enhanced 
          reality available to the average person in museums, hospitals and doctors’ 
          offices, as well as product production in technologically advanced factories.  
          With greater diffusion of technological advances, enhanced reality will 
          become even more widespread in the future.</p>

        </u> 
        <h2>Impact on the Web Professional</h2>
        <p>Web professionals will need to stay informed about the impact of these 
          advanced technologies and may need to integrate these technologies into 
          web development.  For example, they may need to allow access to these 
          technologies from the web by making audio/video streaming downloadable 
          to a user’s enhanced reality hardware/software through the web.  New 
          devices will replace the traditional desktop and laptop computers and 
          peripherals which we use to with web technologies.  </p>
        <h2><span style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></h2>
        <h2>Accessibility Issues</h2>
        <p>Visually and/or hearing impaired individuals may be able to benefit 
          from enhanced reality to the extent that it will improve their existing 
          senses.  Low income or technophobes may not experience the benefits 
          of enhanced reality.</p>

        <h1>Electronic Paper</h1>
        <p><u>Intended Use: </u></p>
        <p>Electronic paper (e-paper) is an emerging technology that combines 
          the convenience of paper or a paper-like medium with digital information 
          such that the paper becomes reusable.  The intended use is to enable 
          the user to reuse the paper in order to read books, magazines, and newspapers.  
          It is thought that some day this medium will actually replace traditional 
          books, magazines, and newspapers.  Although electronic paper has actually 
          been around for a long time, only recent technological advances have 
          made the concept viable.  The technology is currently being used commercially 
          for advertising signs, mainly on in-store displays.</p>
        <p>The following is a sample of electronic paper produced by Bell Labs:</p>
        <p><img border=0 width=200 height=263
src="../../images/emerging_1.jpg"></p>
        <p><span lang=FR>Source: </span><a
href="http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/052301/Prototype_shows_electronic_paper_potential_052301.html"><span
lang=FR>http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/052301/Prototype_shows_electronic_paper_potential_052301.html</span></a></p>
        <p><u>Costs/Drawbacks:</u></p>
        <p>E-paper is made from relatively inexpensive materials, and the manufacturing 
          process is cheaper than that of LCDs.  However, it is more expensive 
          than paper.  One can recover the cost over a period of time that is 
          contingent on the level of use.  However, if you want to have multiple 
          books open at one time, you would need multiple e-paper binders.  </p>
        <p>If e-paper is produced in mass quantities, the costs will become much 
          lower.  Eventually several hundred sheets can be wired together into 
          a book that will cost less than a computer screen.  The cost savings 
          lies in the fact that each sheet can be erased and filled with more 
          text repeatedly.  A single book composed of e-paper could be used and 
          reused more than a million times.<u>  </u></p>
        <p>There is low power consumption required by e-paper.  Once the information 
          is downloaded or “printed” to the e-paper, there is no additional need 
          for a power supply until one wants to change or update the pages because 
          there is a low need for power to operate the e-paper.  Furthermore, 
          the e-paper can be updated via wireless technology.  Future improvements 
          in the technology will render the paper flexible enough to be rolled 
          up.  </p>
        <p>Risks or drawbacks associated with e-paper include a lack of  manufacturers 
          willing to invest in such products until the marketplace has been tested.  
          And, it is uncertain if the market interest will be widespread.  There 
          are still problems associated with the lifespan of current e-paper such 
          that displays currently last between 10,000 and 30,000 hours.  Although 
          there is a low power requirement, the batteries associated with e-paper 
          currently present a problem with weight and flexibility.  </p>
        <h2>Practical Applications:</h2>
        <p>In-store advertising and information signs currently make use of e-paper 
          technology.  In the future, books, magazines, and newspapers may adopt 
          the technology.  Although you can presently use your computer to access 
          reading materials, the convenience of paper that you can take with you 
          anywhere may be what the consumer wants.  Thus, practical applications 
          of e-paper may have a shot in the market place.</p>
        <h2>Competing Technologies:</h2>
        <p>Competing technologies range from news print, books, and magazines 
          to LCD displays and PDA devices.  So, either one will use traditional 
          sources for reading material or one will use existing alternative technological 
          solutions for  viewing printed material.  E-books are already available 
          on-line.  People can read them or down load them to their PDA or pocket 
          pc.</p>
        <h2>Diffusion of Technology:</h2>
        <p>Electronic paper is not very widespread.  Current usage is primarily 
          for in-store signs.  There is still hope that the technology will become 
          widespread with recent technological advances in the development of 
          e-paper.  However, people are already downloading e-books to pocket 
          pc’s.  Perhaps people who are likely to use e-paper are already using 
          existing technology.  Others may not want to replace traditional books, 
          magazines, and newspapers.  </p>
        <p><u>Affect on the Web Professional:</u></p>
        <p>The web professional will have an increased need to recognize that 
          information will be downloaded to varying devices including e-paper.  
          The formatting for e-paper may be very different from that associated 
          with different web browsers or PDA’s.  Thus, the web professional will 
          need to become increasingly flexible with adjusting to new peripherals 
          and their specific formatting requirements.</p>
        <h2>Accessibility Issues</h2>
        <p>Blind or visually impaired individuals will not be able to use e-paper 
          because there is no plan to introduce a Braille version of the new technology.  
          Initially, cost may be an issue for people interested in using e-paper.  
          Over time, cost should decrease to enable greater accessibility.</p>

        <h1>Automatic Code Generation from Pictorial Design Patterns</h1>
        <p><u>Intended Use:</u></p>
        <p>Design patterns increase the level of abstraction for which people 
          can design and communicate the design of software.  A design pattern 
          describes a solution to a recurring software problem in a systematic 
          way in an attempt to capture expertise in building software.  This is 
          intended as a way to decrease development time in code generation for 
          people already trained in code generation.  However, it is also possible 
          for people to successfully use the software without programming experience.  
          Code generation by simply pointing and clicking on pictorial representations 
          of your design pattern will mean increased speed and ease in code development 
          for all.</p>
        <p><u>Costs/Drawbacks:</u></p>
        <p>The costs of automatic code generation from pictorial design patterns 
          consist of the purchase price of the software and start-up time to learn 
          automatic code generation.  Drawbacks associated with this new technology 
          include the development of inefficient code.  A good programmer would 
          probably be able to do a better job of writing the code.  However, a 
          mediocre coder may not do as good a job.</p>
        <p>Often the code generated automatically is not user friendly.  It may 
          be difficult for programmers to understand the code well enough to go 
          in and make their own changes.  Thus, it may be that changes are more 
          difficult to make compared to programmer generated code development..  
        </p>
        <p><u>Practical Applications:</u></p>
        <p>Practical applications for automatic code generation are endless.  
          They include all applications relevant to human code generation.  Automatic 
          code generation from pictorial design patterns will eventually be available 
          to write almost any programming code.  Thus, practically speaking, programmers 
          may not be in as great a demand because of this new technology.  However, 
          the jury is still out on this one!  Others argue that one should be 
          skilled in the underlying program generation in order to successfully 
          use automatic code generation.  I would argue that it may be more important 
          to be skilled in the practical application rather than the code generation.  
          For example, in my opinion, it is more important for a scientist (engineer 
          or mathematician) to understand a project application when using MathWorks’ 
          Simulink, than to understand how to write the code that is generated 
          by the software.  Specific practical applications for Simulink include: 
          system-level design of digital signal processing and communication systems, 
          from algorithm development to simulation, rapid prototyping, and verification.  
          Digital signal processing and communications design has traditionally 
          been tackled by two groups, a developer designing advanced algorithms 
          and an engineer implementing the design in hardware and software.  Simulink 
          allows you to develop, test, and verify designs, i.e., the whole project 
          from concept to testing to coding.  You can design and test satellite 
          communication’s links or test and design aircraft prototypes.  </p>

        <p>Using Vision JADE, another pictorial design pattern software product, 
          officials at Hilton Hotels Corp., in Beverly Hills, Calif., claim better 
          than ten-fold gains in application time to market (six weeks for full 
          development vs. three months to prototype 10% of the system using conventional 
          tools.  Applications for automatic code generation from pictorial design 
          patterns appear endless.</p>
        <p><u>Competing Technologies:</u></p>
        <p>Competing technologies range from hand coding traditional programs 
          to using object-oriented software that does not include automatic implementation 
          of  pictorial design patterns, e.g., C.  Within the competing technology, 
          there is increased competition for code generation software although 
          there is room for coexistence of many tools since they often focus on 
          a particular software application area (e.g., engineering or manufacturing).  
          One example within the engineering realm is SimuLink by MathWorks.  
          Another example is Vision JADE, a CASE tool for Java-based Web development. 
          It allows developers to design applications as models and automatically 
          generate Java code.  </p>
        <p><u>Diffusion of Technology:</u></p>
        <p>http://www.mathworks.com/products/</p>
        <p>This technology is rapidly diffusing as software is rapidly being written 
          for automatic code generation for numerous disciplines.  Research is 
          available regarding how to develop such code and is freely available 
          off the internet (e.g., Automatic Code Generation from Design Patterns 
          by Budinsky, Finnie, and Vlissides).  </p>
        <p>Because application possibilities are endless, this technology will 
          be diffused like wild fire!</p>
        <p><u>Affect on the Web Professional:</u></p>
        <p>Life will get more complicated as automatic code generation from pictorial 
          design patterns diffuses throughout web applications.  For example, 
          with a few clicks, it is now possible to develop and customize a portal 
          system complete with database applications.  This will mean that more 
          people will demand greater functionality in their web sites.  It may 
          also mean that more people will develop their own applications without 
          consulting a web professional.  </p>
        <p><u>Accessibility Issues:</u></p>
        <p>Visually impaired individuals are shut out of this technology at present.  
          Cost impediments may also exist for some.</p>
