        of IT</font></strong></p>
      <p>We'll get to the history of computing in a moment, but first, let's talk 
        a little more about Information Technology (IT). What is it? How is it 
        related to the discipline of Computer Science (CS)? If you are going to 
        work with computers as part (or all) of your profession, what do you need 
        to know? To answer these questions, let's compare IT to CS and take a 
        look at a concept promoted by Dr. Peter Denning called, &quot;Great Principles 
        of Computing&quot;<sup>*</sup>.</p>
      <p><strong>IT and CS</strong></p>
      <p>Definitions of IT vary, but in general, IT encompasses all fields that 
        enable the use of modern digital technology <br>
        to solve problems involving data/information. Professionals in Information 
        Technology must be competent with a variety of skill sets. Some of these 
        include technical skills, communication skills, leadership skills, general 
        business knowledge, strategic thinking skills, the ability to manage with 
        a global perspective, and the ability to lead and collaborate well with 
        teams.</p>
      <p>Computer Science is more technical in nature. It is the study of computation 
        and the mechanical devices involved in computation. These computation 
        processes and devices are designed or &#8220;engineered&#8221;. The processes 
        have mathematical properties and can be evaluated for performance. The 
        design and evaluation of a process is often very experimental in nature.</p>
      <p>A comparison of IT and CS appears in the following table. An interesting 
        analogy to help us think about the differences is that IT professionals 
        learn to utilize the technologies and CS professionals create and define 
        the technologies. There is a significant relationship (and overlap) between 
        the two and it is always good to understand the technologies that you 
        wish to utilize. Keep in mind that this is a simplistic comparison and 
        it is more complex than this, but this is a good start.</p>

      <p><strong>Great Principles of Computing</strong></p>
      <p>When most people think of professions in computing, they automatically 
        think that the only option is to become a programmer. In the paper, &quot;Great 
        Principles of Computing&quot;, Denning tries to present a method of teaching 
        technology to show that it is so much more than just programming. If we 
        take a look at what Denning points out as the core technologies of computing, 
        we see that learning and performing programming is just one piece of what 
        we need to learn about technology.</p>

      <p>From this list of core technologies, many may miss the greater picture 
        of what technology is all about. From this list, Denning has created a 
        &quot;principles-based&quot; view of technology to bring the bigger picture 
        into focus and to help us understand what we need to know in the study 
        of technology</p>
      <p>Denning breaks the study of technology into two parts, the first being 
        computing practices. Computing practices enables us to put everything 
        we know together to make it useful, supporting the abilities to program, 
        engineer systems, build models of systems to help make predictions, innovate 
        or make changes to procedures and organizations, and through the creation 
        of applications to support people and their work.</p>
      <p>The second part involves the great principles of computing, which is 
        further broken down into those principles involved in design and those 
        involved in mechanics.</p>
      <p>Principles of Mechanics:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Computation: What can be computed and what are the limits of computing?</li>
        <li>Communication: How can the transmission of messages occur from one 
          point to another?</li>
        <li>Coordination: How can multiple entities cooperate to achieve a single 
          goal?</li>
        <li>Automation: How can cognitive tasks can be performed by a computer?</li>
        <li>Recollection: How can information be stored and retrieved?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Principles of Design:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Simplicity: How can we avoid complexity?</li>
        <li>Performance: How can we predict and enhance performance.</li>
        <li>Reliability: How do we keep devices and information available when 
          needed? </li>
        <li>Evolvabililty: Can our design be adaptable to changes of function 
          or scale?</li>
        <li>Security: How do we allow or limit access as needed?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Principles of Computing Mechanics deal with the structure and operation 
        of computations. Knowing how the structures are built and work does not 
        cover everything in the field of technology. The Principles of Design 
        pick up to enable the mechanics to perform in the service of people. Computing 
        Practices put everything together to bring this service to actuality.</p>
      <p><strong>So what?</strong></p>
      <p>This course is the first course in the study of Information Technology. 
        Our hope is that this wider view of the study of technology may provide 
        for a better understanding of the big picture. During our study of the 
        core technologies, keep in mind why we are studying each topic and of 
        the ultimate goals of the study of technology. We'll try to revisit the 
        great principles as we go along. Also keep in mind that each core technology 
        has its own history of creation and development. As you proceed through 
        the history of computing, see if you can determine the context of that 
        history and where it fits into the big picture.</p>
      <p>* &quot;Great Principles of Computing&quot;, Denning, Peter J.; <u>Communications 
        of the ACM</u>; November 2003; Vol. 46, No. 11; pp 15-20.</p>
      <p><strong><font size="6">History of Computing</font></strong></p>
      <p>The history of technology and computing has roots in the history of communications 
        and math.  Early calculating machines such as the abacus and ancient constructions 
        such as Stonehenge were used to track the rising and setting of the sun, 
        moon, and stars.  Humankind recorded and shared information from early 
        cave painting days to enable generational leaps to occur which eventually 
        resulted in today’s computing power.  What follows is an attempt to capture 
        historically significant developments that brought us to today’s technological 
        innovations.  </p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
      <p>The voice, stories, cave painting, poem, dance, music, art, pottery, 
        plays, coin, alphabets, letters, books, laws, horses, ships, and even 
        birds have all been part of the history of human communication.   The 
        traveling bard and the census taker have taken news from one place to 
        another. The captains and dames of industry have mapped and catalogued 
        suppliers foreign and domestic since proverbs was written.   The code 
        of Manu (1500 <span class=SpellE>b.c</span><span
class=GramE>.)</span> had restrictions on communication and learning,  and <span class=SpellE>Hamurabi</span> 
        (more than 2000 <span class=SpellE>b.c</span>.)  <span class=GramE>required</span> 
        judges to write their decision and reasoning for public record restrictions 
        on who is allowed to communicate with whom.  Communication and the storage 
        of information <span class=GramE>is</span> critical to human society. 
        It defines us and refines us.  Some would argue that it confines us as 
        well.   <b><br>
        <br>
        </b>Yet we live in an age when communication is unleashed in ways that 
        were merely the stuff of science fiction twenty years ago. Cell phones, 
        talking computers, wireless networks, <span class=GramE>500</span> hours 
        of music all on a box the size of a pack of cigarettes..</p>
      <p>Thus the reality of information technology is that it is in some ways 
        merely just one more <span class=GramE>step</span> in advancing our ability 
        as individuals and societies to communicate.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>The Histories of Information </b><b>Technology</b></p>
      <p>Well I would like to write a nice biographical sketch of all this, but 
        there are much better places to go and the topic is really an encyclopedia 
        not a chapter, so we will take a slightly different approach.  We will 
        begin by perusing the history of computing from <a href="http://computerhope.org" target="_blank">computer 
        hope.org</a>. </p>
      <p>Having read this, we will take an interesting approach to the history 
        of computers - this is where we start to get very interactive. A database 
        driven website has been created where you will be able to paste information 
        into a web form, assign some additional data to the form and then update 
        the database.  This is esentially a database of computer and technology 
        histories. The key assigments for this section are to read and research 
        some element of computing or technology history and update this history 
        website with this additional material from additional sites. Some suggestions 
        to get you started are listed below (the actual assignment is discussed

        History of Computers - Assignment #1</b></p>
      <p>After reviewing the history of technology and computing, what do you 
        feel is the most significant breakthrough in the history of IT. In other 
        words, in your opinion, what single development has had the greatest impact 
        on the field of IT and/or the greatest impact on society. Go to Moodle 
        and and navgiate to the Discussion Boards and respond.</p>
      <p>You will update the histories from this information (or other websites 
        that you may find).  For the <span
class=SpellE>biopods</span> in the class please go to the <span class=SpellE>biohistories</span> 
        page and work from that set of links. <b> Hints for the assignment:</b> 
        How to structure your thoughts as you plow through these histories</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Remember the context</strong> that these technologies were 
          developed/invented to (1) serve a purpose, (2) make money, (3) in a 
          social context—i.e. we all know porn and music drove/drive the internet
