<h2><a name="OBJECTIVES"></a>Objectives:</h2>
<p > This course represents an introduction to information technology, the concepts of information systems and the "Information Age". Students will develop an understanding of basic computing and information systems principles and the social implications of information and information technology. The course also provides an overview on the creation, organization, analysis, storage, retrieval, and communication of information.</p>
<p >The overall goal of this course 
  is to provide students with a basic introduction to technology and to illustrate the notion that technology has and will continue 
  to permeate all aspects of society. Given this, it is desirable to have the 
  students develop a basic familiarity with the subject area to the extent that they can apply basic skills in databases, networks, 
  web development, and multimedia applications. However, course examples 
  may go beyond the basic subject matter in order to demonstrate 
  that information technology can be applied to any field. An anticipated outcome 
  of this course is that each student will be able to apply the skills that they 
  learn to any discipline.</p>

</font></p><h2><font size="-1"><a name="POLICIES"></a><a href="http://jcsites.juniata.edu/faculty/wrightj/policies.htm">Course policies</a></font></h2><font size="-1">
<p>The standard course policies are described on the web page linked above. 
  Please read these carefully, especially on academic integrity. The following special policies are meant to further clarify requirements for this section of this course. </p>
<h2><b><font size="+2">Special Online Policies:</font></b></h2>
<p>These special policies apply to this course due to the online implementation. </p>
<ul>
  <li>All work for this course is to be done individually by the person signed up for the course.</li>
  <li>You are responsible for your own progress in this course. There will be videos, readings, assignments, and discussions to participate in weekly, with occasional quizzes and exams.</li>
  <li>For each week of the course, please check Moodle, looking for and doing any of the following that are available:  </li>
  <ol>
    <li>Read the online material from the course content for the given topic of the day. The link to this material can be found above under "Textbooks" or at the top of the Moodle page for the course.</li>
    <li>Read the assigned chapters in the zyBook and do all of the participation activities found there. </li>
    <li>Look for and watch any video lectures, interactive powerpoint presentations, or tutorial videos available.</li>
    <li>Read and participate in any forums (discussion boards) that are available. </li>
    <li>Check out and do any assignments, making sure to submit them by the due date specified.</li>
    <li>Look for and do any quizzes or exams available. </li>
  </ol>
  <li>Your instructor will be available daily to check email, answer questions, and also participate in forums. Please use this resource. You are not on your own even though we are not meeting in a traditional classroom.</li>
  <li>Sometimes there is a tendency to be more casual online than when in person. This can be good, just remember to continue to treat everyone with the same respect that you would have for them if you were speaking directly to them in person. Arguments can be very educational, just remember to argue respectfully and constructively.  </li>
  <li>Even though we are not technically "in  class", when you watch the videos or peruse a Powerpoint or read the text, take notes. The act of writing turns a passive activity into an active one and helps the memory. And remember, you can always pause or replay the videos, which you can't do with a live lecture, so take advantage of it.</li>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
